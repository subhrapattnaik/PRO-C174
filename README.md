Everything around us is made up of atoms; these are the smallest particles that exist in nature.

Atoms combine together to form molecules and compounds.


Chemical compounds are formed by the combination of two or more atoms of different elements


Also the atom is made up of three particles called neutrons, protons and electrons.

Neutrons and protons combined together is called the nucleus of the atom, which is at the centre of the
atom. 
And electrons revolve around the nucleus in a certain configuration, called atomic orbitals


This representation of atoms, with the nucleus, electrons and atomic orbitals, of elements is known as the atomic
structure of the elements

Some electrons are free to move out of these orbitals when they try to form compounds

we cannot break the atom down further into these particles.

we are going to make atomic structures of some elements in Augmented reality.
------------------------

We are going to make a marker based application again but we are going to use the different kinds of
markers that are called barcode markers.
These markers are special kinds of markers which have unique ID values assigned to them starting with 0.


There are differenttypes of barcode markers based on the way the detection information has
been stored in the form of matrix. The most popular are 3X3 and 4X4 matrix code type barcode
markers


The periodic table shows the elements with their chemical symbol and
properties like their mass and number of electrons in the tabular structure
